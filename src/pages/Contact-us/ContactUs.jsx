        <p className="About-para">
          In 2017, the Android Club was established at VIT Bhopal by Abhay Nigam
          from the '17 batch, with early members like Toshin Ghosh, Rohan
          Sarkar, and Tamanna Kapoor joining one by one. Initially, we faced
          challenges organizing events without formal backing, but our passion
          for Android development and the guidance of senior mentors kept us
          going. Hackathons quickly became our hallmark, attracting students
          eager to learn app develop and compete. Under the leadership of
          Abhinav from the '20 batch and Harsh from the '21 batch, we expanded
          our scope within mobile technology to include backend development, ML
          integration, and IoT applications. Regular seminars by experienced
          seniors equipped our members with the knowledge and confidence to
          excel in hackathons and coding competitions. As we continue to grow,
          the Android Club remains committed to fostering creativity, knowledge,
          and leadership in mobile technology. We promise even greater
          achievements, setting new milestones and pushing boundaries in Android
          development. By adapting to the latest trends, we ensure our members
          are well-prepared for the dynamic field of mobile technology.
